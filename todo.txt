Open arbitrary new window

Weirdness in media library "Can't rename". Also need thumbnails/icons for video and audio.
Media library screen is a little plain. Make it prettier. Add trash button.

Embed stuff like Zoom and Big Blue button? Nah, better in a new window I think. Think some more about this.

Some sort of bug with the screen time for popup messages (e.g. the one about experimental languages)


Split screen editor?

* Test importing of audio and video.

Nope, don't do this. Make CTRL-S and CMD-S save the current editor (as well as ESC). Or save all editors and download? Maybe that would be better, come to think about it.

Nope. Just add "return to show" button. I think that CTRL/CMD-S should save the editor and return to the slide show, if the slide editor is active. If on the home screen, should download the self-contained app. Think about this some more, though.

Clicking too fast skips transitions. Need to queue them up somehow. This is still happening somehow. Unrecognized race condition? Continue to investigate. Seems to be fixed? Torture test this.

Icons needed: Video, audio, book, external link, internal link...

Inline LaTeX example on slide isn't working.
