1) Don't piss me off.
2) While there are many things that might piss me off, attempting to play rules lawyer with this Code of Conduct is **guaranteed** to piss me off. It's not negotiable. It's not up for debate. If you don't like it, your screen has a fork button on it the same as mine.
3) There are about a billion places on the internet to discuss/virtue signal/argue about politics. This isn't one of them. That's another thing that is pretty much guaranteed to piss me off. I'm just writing code, mang. Saving the world is gonna have to be done somewhere else.

That's it. That's the CoC.
